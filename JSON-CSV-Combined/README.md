# JSON and CSV Combined Exercises
This directory contains 15 Python exercises combining JSON and CSV file handling, designed for practical data science applications. The exercises are split into three levels: Basic (1-5), Intermediate (6-10), and Challenging (11-15). Each exercise processes data between `sales.csv` (with "product", "quantity", "price" columns) and JSON files.

## Objectives
- Combine CSV and JSON data processing.
- Perform data aggregation, filtering, and transformation.
- Prepare data for analysis in data science workflows.

## Exercises
Below are the 15 exercises with their descriptions and solutions.

### Exercise 1: Calculate Total Sales from CSV to JSON
**Question:**  
Write a Python program that reads `sales.csv` (with columns "product", "quantity", "price"), calculates the total quantity sold per product, and saves the result to `total_sales.json` as a dictionary. Handle errors like missing files or invalid data.

**Solution:** See `1_csv_to_json_sales.py`.
