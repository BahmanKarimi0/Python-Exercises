# CSV Handling Exercises

### Exercise 1: Count Students in CSV
**Question:**  
Write a Python program that reads the file `students.csv` (assume itâ€™s a CSV file with columns "name", "age", "grade"), counts the total number of students, and prints the count to the console. Handle errors like missing files.

**Hint:**  
Use `csv.reader` or `csv.DictReader` to read the file. Loop through the rows to count students, skipping the header.

**Solution:** See `01_csv_count_students.py`.
