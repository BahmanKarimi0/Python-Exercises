# File Handling Exercises

## Exercise 1: Writing to a Text File
**Question:**  
Write a Python program that takes a text input from the user (using `input`) and saves it to a file named `my_text.txt`. If the file already exists, the new text should be appended to the end of the file (not overwrite it).

**Hint:** Use `open()` with the `'a'` (append) mode.

**Solution:** See `01_write_to_file.py`.

## Exercise 2: Reading the Whole File
**Question:**  
Write a Python program that reads the entire content of the file `my_text.txt` and prints it to the console as a single string.

**Hint:**  
Use `open()` with the `'r'` (read) mode and the `read()` method.

**Solution:** See `02_read_file.py`.
