# File Handling Exercises

## Exercise 1: Writing to a Text File
**Question:**  
Write a Python program that takes a text input from the user (using `input`) and saves it to a file named `my_text.txt`. If the file already exists, the new text should be appended to the end of the file (not overwrite it).

**Hint:** Use `open()` with the `'a'` (append) mode.

**Solution:** See `01_write_to_file.py`.
