# JSON Handling Exercises
This directory contains exercises for working with JSON files in Python, divided into three levels: Simple, Medium, and Challenging.

## Exercise 1: Read JSON File
**Question:**  
Write a Python program that reads the file `data.json` (assume it contains a simple dictionary with keys "name" and "age") and prints its contents to the console.

**Hint:**  
Use the `json` module and the `load` function to read the file. Open the file with `open` and close it properly (or use `with`).

**Solution:** See `01_json_read.py`.
