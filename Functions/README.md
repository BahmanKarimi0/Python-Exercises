# Functions Exercises
This section is dedicated to exploring and practicing Python functions through a series of 20 exercises. The exercises are divided into four levels of difficulty: 5 simple, 5 medium, 5 hard, and 5 challenging. Each exercise focuses on building and strengthening skills in defining functions, handling inputs/outputs, and solving problems with increasing complexity. The goal is to master function creation and usage while tackling practical programming scenarios.

### Exercise 01: Power Function (Simple)
**Question:**  
Write a function `power(base, exp)` that calculates `base` raised to the power of `exp` using only multiplication (no `**` or `pow`). Assume `exp` is a non-negative integer.

**Solution:** See `01_simple.py`.

### Exercise 02: Prime Number Check (Simple)
**Question:**  
Write a function `is_prime(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` (>1) and returns `True` if itâ€™s a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

**Solution:** See `02_is_prime.py`.

============================================

### Exercise 03: Reverse String (Simple)
**Question:**  
Write a function `reverse_string(s)` that takes a string `s` and returns its reverse, using only loops or simple operations (no `[::-1]` or `reversed`).

**Solution:** See `03_reverse_string.py`.
