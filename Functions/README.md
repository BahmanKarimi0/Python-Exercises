# Functions Exercises
This section is dedicated to exploring and practicing Python functions through a series of 20 exercises. The exercises are divided into four levels of difficulty: 5 simple, 5 medium, 5 hard, and 5 challenging. Each exercise focuses on building and strengthening skills in defining functions, handling inputs/outputs, and solving problems with increasing complexity. The goal is to master function creation and usage while tackling practical programming scenarios.
